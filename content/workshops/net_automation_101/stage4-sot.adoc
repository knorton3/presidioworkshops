== Stage 4 Source Of Truth

image::s4-0.png['Stages', 1000]

== In Stage 4, we will discuss what a source of truth is and how it is related to network automation.  

== We will run through some of the concepts to understand how to use Nautobot as a source of truth to validate changes.

== Using a source of truth (SoT) will define the intended or desired state of the network infrastructure and help validate changes before they are pushed to production.  

---

== Here are the requirements for Stage 4

== Here is a diagram of Stage 4.  This shows all the technology we will be using in Stage 4.  

== It also defines the use cases we will be working on in Stage 4.

== **Let’s Build A Nautobot Server**
[IMPORTANT]
Login to Server 2

=== On Server 2
=== Run the following command to bring up a Nautobot container
[IMPORTANT]
This is an all in one lab instance of Nautobot.  **This is not for Production.**
[source, bash]
----
docker run -itd --restart=always --name nautobot -p 8000:8000 --env NAPALM_USERNAME="admin" --env NAPALM_PASSWORD="admin" networktocode/nautobot-lab:latest
----
=== This will spin up nautobot server in minutes
=== Create a superuser account after the container comes up
=== Run the following command
[source, bash]
----
docker exec -it nautobot nautobot-server createsuperuser
----

[source, bash]
----
cloud_user@ed26757f4b2c:~/nautobot$ docker exec -it nautobot nautobot-server createsuperuser
Username: support
Email address: knorton@presidio.com
Password: 
Password (again): 
Superuser created successfully.
cloud_user@ed26757f4b2c:~/nautobot$

---

== **Let's Configure The Nautobot Server**
=== Log into the Nautobot server
=== Open a web browser and go to:
[source, bash]
----
http://server2:8000 <1>
----
<1> Replace server2 with IP address or FQDN of your server 2

=== Click Login in the upper right-hand corner
=== Enter the superuser username and password you just created
=== Notice nothing is configured, but browse around

image::s4-25.png[caption="Figure 1: ", title='Login To Nautobot', 200] 

---

image::s4-26.png[caption="Figure 2: ", title='Welcome To Nautobot', 400]

---

== **Let’s Configure A Nautobot Server**

=== As you can see there is no data in the Source Of Truth (SOT)
=== Let’s add some data via the API and web interface
=== First, we need to create a token on the Nautobot server
=== Once you are logged into Nautobot 
=== Go to the pull down of your account name in the upper right hand corner and select admin
=== Under Users -> click on Tokens
=== Click add in the right hand corner
=== Select your username and click save
=== Copy the new token down to safe location

image::s4-27.png[caption="Figure 3: ", title='Nautobot Token', 400]

---

=== Let's hop onto server 1 (the server running the GitLab runner)  and install some Ansible plugins for Nautobot
=== Login as a user
=== Install the following plugins – pynautobot and the nautobot ansible collection v4.5

[source, bash]

[IMPORTANT]
<1> DON’T Install the latest version of the nautobot ansible plugin


=== Let’s add the token to the environmental variables of the server
=== In production the recommendation would be to encrypt the token with a Vault application from Ansible or Hashicorp, but this is just for lab purposes
[source, bash]
----
cloud_user@ed26757f4b1c:~/nautobot/add_device$ export NB_TOKEN="fbf4caacbd265dfc88aa430be6c31650a84179a7" <1>

----
<1> Replace your token in the command above

=== Then cd into the ~/network-automation/infra/nautobot/ directory to run the playbook
=== This will add data to your Nautobot server 
[source, bash]
----
cloud_user@ed26757f4b1c:~/network-automation/infra/nautobot$ ansible-playbook add_info.yaml -vv
----
---
=== Go back to the Web Browser and refresh the Nautobot server
=== Click on Devices -> Devices
=== You should see 5 devices
=== Check out the devices by clicking on a device

image::s4-28.png[caption="Figure 4: ", title='Nautobot Devices', 300]

---
=== To support the new VLAN change
=== Click IPAM -> IP Addresses and select 192.168.13.1/24
=== Click Edit in upper right-hand corner
=== Scroll down to Interface Assignment and select the following:

image::s4-29.png[caption="Figure 5: ", title='Nautobot Interface Assignment', 200]

=== Click update and click IP Addresses and then click on the 192.168.14.1/24 IP Address and assign vlan14 to the same device under the Interface Assignment section
=== On the IP Address page you should see the checkboxes for assigned

image::s4-30.png[caption="Figure 6: ", title='Nautobot IP Addresses', 100]

=== Now we have associated the two new VLANs to the Leaf3 switch
=== Next we need to add the SNMP change to Nautobot

---
=== Click on the Extensibility drop down and select Config Context
image::s4-31.png[caption="Figure 7: ", title='Config Context', 300]
=== Add a new Config Context
=== Name it snmp and scroll down to the data section
=== Add the following JSON data into the data section and click Create:
[source, bash]
----
{
    "config": {
        "communities": [
            {
                "acl_v4": "list3",

                "version": "2c"
            }
        ]
    }
}
----
=== This will add the SNMP configuration to each Switch
=== Click on a device and verify the SNMP Config Context
---
=== Instead of creating the VLAN and SNMP change using static data from the playbook and host_vars
=== Lets add the new VLANs and SNMP from the Source of Truth (SoT) Nautobot
=== This will allow us to query the SoT prior to successfully adding the changes to production
=== Now let's create a couple Ansible Playbooks to grab the data from the SoT and create configurations from it for the change
=== The change will remain the same, open the change_sot folder and review the get_ip.yaml.
=== Notice the variables we will query in Nautobot
=== Check out the Nautobot Query - This introduces the GraphQL

<1> We can use variables in GitLab

=== On the Gitlab Server in the Network Automation repository
=== Go to Settings -> CI/CD -> and expand variables
=== Click Add variable and add the variable using NB_TOKEN as the key, your token as the key and click Mask variable and click the Add variable button
=== Click Add variable and add the variable using NB_HOST as the key, your url of the Nautobot server with port 8000 (http://server2:8000) as the key and click Mask variable and click the Add variable button

[IMPORTANT]
Replace server2 with the FQDN of your server

=== It is a good habit to first sync up changes with a remote repository before working on it
=== Run the following command:
[source, bash]
----
git branch

=== Notice that I am starting out on the Master branch
=== It’s a good idea to check if your local repository is out of date from the remote repository
