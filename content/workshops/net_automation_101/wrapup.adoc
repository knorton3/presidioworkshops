That wraps up what we have planned for today.  We hope you've learned something
valuable about Network Automation that you can apply in your daily role.

What do you think? How can we help you understand Network Automation better?

Please provide feedback so we can make it better and enhance the workshop.

Thank you for your time and participation!
